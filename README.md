This is code for applying DeepState (https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate) to the classic TCAS code,
taken from the SIR (Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository, https://sir.csc.ncsu.edu/portal/bios/tcas.php).

Properties are taken from http://wcl.cs.rpi.edu/pilots/library/papers/collision/tcas_software_verification_using_constraint_programming.pdf
-- like that paper, we confirm the classic version of the code can violate some reasonable-seeming properties for the system.
